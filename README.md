## Description
Vehicle Builder is a TypeScript command-line application that allows users to create, manage, and interact with a variety of vehicles. Initially designed for cars, the application has been expanded to include motorbikes and trucks. Users can either build a new vehicle or select an existing one, and then perform specific actions such as popping a wheelie or towing another vehicle. The application is interactive, guiding users through vehicle creation, selection, and action menus until they choose to exit.
